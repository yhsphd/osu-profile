Thank you for being part of this big community project! We, Endless Mirage, hope you enjoy all the materials you've received for participating in this collab.

You will notice there is a bunch of files in this zip, please read carefully as some materials have many file types delivered for quality sake.

1. The avatar
The avatar is delivered as a mp4, GIF and Static PNG. You should use the GIF file in osu! as it's the one animated. However you're free to use the Static PNG. 
The mp4 is the full quality animation, if you would like to use it somewhere else.

2. The Banner
The banner is delivered as a mp4 and as an APNG. The APNG will be animated once it's put in osu!. However it might not appear animated in your photo viewer, mostly because
it is not supported, but if you open the file using a browser it will appear animated. To use the banner, upload it to an image hosting service such as imgur and  copy the 
link of the image into your me! section of osu! with the code [img]i.imgur.com/someid.png[/img]. Usage is optional and if you don't have a me! section it you don't need to 
use this banner.
The mp4 is the full quality animation, if you would like to use it somewhere else.

3. The Card
There is 2 files for the Card, one with your rank and level and one without it. As rank and level might get outdated in the long run, you can use the other file to manually 
put your rank and level using some photo editor. Note that only the file with your rank and level is an APNG and the one without it is not animated. To use the card, upload 
it to an image hosting service such as imgur and copy the link of the image into your signature field (which is in settings) as [img]i.imgur.com/someid.png[/img]. 
The usage of the card is optional.

4. The Header
This file goes for your profile header. Usage is optional and if you don't have osu! supporter you don't need to use this file.

**Please stay tuned to our discord server as we will post the BBCode for the global banner there.**

Hope to see you and your friends in the next megacollab!
